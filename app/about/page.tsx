        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Welcome to <strong>Little Steps and Palabras Preschool</strong>, where we believe in nurturing young minds in a vibrant, family-centered environment! Our preschool is more than just a place of learning — it's a community built on a passion for early childhood education and a deep love for working with children.

        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          We specialize in providing exceptional care and education for children aged 3 to 5 years old. What truly sets us apart is our immersive Spanish language program. We understand the incredible benefits of early language, and our curriculum seamlessly integrates Spanish throughout the day, giving your child a natural and engaging path to learn a new language.

          At Little Steps and Palabras, learning extends beyond traditional academics. We foster creativity and physical expression through dedicated hours of dance, creative movement, and artistic activities. This unique blend ensures a well-rounded educational experience that sparks joy and encourages self-expression.

          Our team is comprised of a dedicated family trio: my mother, my sister, and myself. With 25 years of experience in early childhood education, my mother leads our passionate team, bringing a wealth of knowledge and expertise to our classrooms. We are all deeply committed to creating a supportive and enriching atmosphere where every child can thrive, take “little steps” in their development, and discover the “palabras” (words) that open up a world of possibilities.
        </p>
